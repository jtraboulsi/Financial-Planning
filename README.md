# Financial-Planning
Use of financial APIs, Monte Carlo Simulation and visualization techniques on Python

In this exercise, I used financial APIs and implemented GET requests to obtain current and historical pricing data for crypto currencies as well as traditional securities. The pricing information was used to determine the current value and composition of a crypto asset portfolio as well as its realtive size to a suggested emergency money fund for a hypothetical client. The pricing information obtained via the API was also used to run a Monte Carlo simulation and to analyze the simulated cumulative returns for a 30 year moderate portfolio (60/40 in equities and bonds, respectively) as well as the potential outcomes of a more aggresive portfolio (80/20). I used visualition techiniques to make the analysis easier to understand. For instance, by displaying a histogram of simulated final cumulative returns for both model portfolios, it made it readily evident that both portfolios carried distinct return distribution profiles. Plotting the crypto asset portfolio on a pie chart allowed us to visually capture the relative size of each of its components as well.
